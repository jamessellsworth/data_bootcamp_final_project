# data_bootcamp_final_project
This project was completed by James Ellsworth in partial fulfillment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2020. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para-phrasing thereof- has been fully ad appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a file to abide by the NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description
This project uses the Paleobiology Database to allow users to get a better understanding of the geology surrounding their location (or any other location inputted). Users can input a location, learn about the history of the geology that surrounds them, and find out about interesting findings made near their inputted location. This tool can be used by people interested in paleontology wishing to track and analyze findings documented in the PBDB. A more niche use that is specific to this program is the stratgroup, formation, and member categorization tool which allows users to get a compelte picture of the different formations that surround them. The tool can also be used by anyone that wants to try fossil hunting on their own. The interactive maps and visualized data about their surrounding geology can give users a good idea of what sortof fossils they can expect to find, as well as where they might be able to find it.
